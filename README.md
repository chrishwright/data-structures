# Data Structures

Examples of various data structures.  Currently going through my grad-school data structures text book and thought it'd 
be useful to store these somewhere.

## Installation

Maven is required to run this project.  And Java.  There isn't really anything in the App.java file,
the unit tests are what can be used to demonstrate the functionality.

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn test
```
